            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the departure of his Excellence the Earle of Warwick from our Fleet, we have no way forgot our duty, but beene in a conſtant po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of War about our coaſts ever ſince, watching the approaches of all Ships that might give any aſſiſtance to the Malignants againſt the high Court of Parliament. On Saturday the fifth of November two of our ſhips had in chaſe neare the Iſland of Silley a French bottome, who upon view of us ſtood out to Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: Sir <hi>David Murrey</hi> therefore (being a nimble Sailer) undertook her, and after two houres chaſe haled her aboard; but ſhe made no anſwer, but clapt on more ſailes to get the wind, which being ſomewhat ſcant ſhe had no poſſibility of eſcape. After the diſcharge of two Guns (one of which ſhore her Mizzen by the board) ſhe came in, being indeed a French Veſſell, and of S. <hi>Malos;</hi> her loading (as her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter affirmed) being Normandy-Canvas, and other Linnen, and that they were bound for Southampton: Being inquired of why they ſhunned us, they anſwered, they tooke us for Dunkirk men of War. But going down into her hold, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome ſlight packs of linnen cloth (the ſerpent lurking under that graſſe) wee diſcerned ſome bales of Match, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156233:3"/>barrels of Powder; three hundred Muskets, or thereabouts; three Field-Pieces; five hundred Caſe of Piſtolls, and as many Carabines. So finding by the lading that there was ſome further miſchiefe convaied in that Veſſell, Sir <hi>David</hi> examined the Maſter, for what end all that Ammunition was prepared, by whom put aboard him, and whither bound? After ſome flight excuſes he told he was bound for Penrin in Cornwall; that he was fraught with thoſe goods by the procuration of ſome Engliſh Gentlemen in S. <hi>Malos;</hi> that that man (pointing to one in a Saylers habit) could better informe; who being ſtrictly called to queſtion, was found to be one Maſter <hi>Greenvill,</hi> a Kinſman to Sir <hi>Bevill Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> that perverſe Malignant, ſent by him and Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> to make purchaſe of thoſe Armes and that Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition in France: which partly with money from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Knights, and by the aſſiſtance of Maſter <hi>Termyn</hi> (whoſe cred it is good in France) meeting him at S. <hi>Malos,</hi> was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed. Letters there were found about the ſaid <hi>Greenvill,</hi> in certain myſtick characters, from Maſter <hi>Termyn</hi> to the ſaid Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> and Sir <hi>Bevill Greenvill,</hi> which with the Veſſell we made ſtay of, intending as ſoon as poſſibly ſhe could be brought up the River (being an old leaky Veſſell) to ſend her to London, with the ſaid <hi>Greenvill</hi> and ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the diſpoſe of the honourable the Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>On Sunday the ſixth of November, our Fleet being twelve ſhips in company, to the ſtarboard of us we eſpied two ſhips, as far off as we could ken, which made towards us with all ſailes: and upon their nearer approach we perceived them to be of good burden, and (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s we conjectured) men of War: they taking us for Merchants bound outward, were reſolved to ſee our lading; and ſo comming within ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156233:3"/>neare diſtance, they were found to be Turks men of War: They perceiving us not to be the men they tooke us for, tackt about, and faine would have been gone: But the Fidler plaid <hi>No ſuch matter,</hi> we made account they ſhould not part ſo eaſily with us; and ſo our Rere-admirall Sir <hi>Iohn Menns,</hi> with two of our ſhips, the <hi>Aſſurance</hi> and a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of five hundred Ton, undertooke them: the Rogues ſeeing no way but they muſt fight, their waſt-cloaths out, and all things ready, they gave us a broad ſide of at leaſt thirty Guns from both of them, making amain towards us, hoping (having a full wind to friend, and being light nimble Veſſels) to have got through our Fleet and eſcaped: But Captaine <hi>Millar</hi> that commanded in the Merchant gave their Admirall a ſalute, that ſpoiled part of his haſte, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his fore-maſt clean by the board: the <hi>Aſſurance</hi> alſo out of her Fore-caſtle ſhooting her great Guns at her, tore her without mercy, ſo that the Rogues were but in an ill plight; yet would they not yeeld, but ſtood ſtoutly to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well mand, playing upon us with their Muskets, and caſting fire-pots over into the Merchant-man with great fury and agility, but thanks be to God they did ſmall hurt. At laſt Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> laid their Vice-admirall aboard, and though thoſe miſcreants would have diſcharged their Murderers to cleare their Decks, yet our men were got into their Cabin ere they could give fire: with that they cryed for Quarter, which was granted; and their Admirall perceiving his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions misfortune, ſtruck his top, and ſubmitted himſelfe to mercy. There was in both the ſhips a hundred and forty men left alive, threeſcore being in the fight ſent to their Prophets Paradiſe. We loſt but foure men. There was in them threeſcore good braſſe Guns, eight and thirty in the Admirall, and two and twenty in the other; abundance of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156233:4"/>ammunition, which was their lading, being (as their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain confeſſed) bound with it for Ireland, to ſell to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, with whom they have continuall traffick for thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, ſince their inſurrection: thoſe incarnate Devils being debard of all help from Chriſtian Princes (to whom they are deteſtable for their rebellion) trading with theſe Turks. Howſoever, for this time we have mard their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and made lawfull prize of men, veſſels, and goods, which ſhortly ſhall be ſent up to London, to teſtifie our good wils to ſerve the King and Parliament.</p>
            <p>Within foure dayes after this, one of our leſſer ſhips brought in a Holland Catch, which it had taken going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Milford</hi> haven in Wales, whither it was bound; there being in her a ſervant of my Lord <hi>Digbies,</hi> whoſe Pockets were well ſtuft with Letters; ſome of which, it ſhould ſeem thoſe of conſequence, he caſt over-board: thoſe that were found about him, were from his Lord to the Earle of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoll, wherein he much bewailes his abſence from his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, wiſhing he were here to ſerve the King againſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, entreating him to ſend him over ſome money, for that he was in great want: that for ammunition, as powder, ſhot, and the like, he was afflicted he could ſend over no more, having neither credit nor money for that purpoſe; which if he had it were to little end, the States being ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to comply with the Parliament, that they had abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prohibited the exportation of that kind of merchandiſe. Other letters there were, from him to Commiſſary <hi>Wilm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t,</hi> from Sir <hi>Frederick Cornwallis</hi> to Sir <hi>Edward Stradling,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Aſhburnham,</hi> and other Malignants, but of no impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: Howſoever, they are with us in ſafe cuſtody.</p>
            <p>The next day was brought in by the Aſſurance a French man of Nantz in Brittain, a very good ſhip; there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:156233:4"/>aboard her but Wines and Linnen cloth: her Cocket ſpoke ſhe was bound for London; and ſo finding nothing in her that could be prejudiciall to the State or high Court of Parliament, wee diſmiſſed her in friendly manner. And that afternoon we had ſight of two Veſſels, but they were ſo nimble we could not reach them all night; but in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by that it was cleare we had gotten within musket ſhot of them, and found them to be French bottomes. We hal'd them aboard, and after we had well ranged them up and downe, we found great ſtore of Ammunition in them; ſome twelve great barrells of Gun-powder, an hundred Muskets or thereabouts, with much Match: the men we found to be moſt part Iriſh, the owners of the Barks being Iriſh Friars, Prieſts, and Jeſuites, that had bought them at Dunkirk, and fraught them with that lading, which they intended (as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Phelim O-Connor</hi> their principall Ring-leader confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) to have tranſported into Ireland, to their Country-men the Rebels; the ſaid <hi>O-Connor</hi> having about him the Popes Bull, wherein hee gave full abſolution and remiſſion of all their ſinnes to thoſe that aſſiſted the Catholike cauſe in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, proclaiming all thoſe Martyrs that ſhould ſuffer death in that quarrell. Our Souldiers and Sea-men made very good ſport with his Holineſſe Bull, which (with the Friars) nothing fearing the Popes curſes, we made ſtay of, as alſo of their ammunition, which ſhall ſerve to better uſe then they intended it. There was alſo among other Trinkets a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied banner, which the Pope had ſent to that arch-Rebell Sir <hi>Phelim O-Neale,</hi> creating him his chiefe Champion, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituling him the great <hi>O-Neale,</hi> and King of Ulſter.</p>
            <p>The next day, off from the Iſle of Wight we had another veſſell in ſight, and though we did what we could poſſible to bring her in, ſhe made ſo faſt to ſea, having a full wind, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:156233:5"/>we could not fetch her up: ſo after all that daies ſailing, with the night we loſt ſight of her. What ſhe was we could not conjecture, but certainly ſhe was laden with no good Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, becauſe ſhe refuſed to come in, and fled from us with ſuch ſpeed. Some were of opinion that ſhe was a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but I rather beleeve ſhe was ſome French bottome, fraught with Ammunition, and bound either for Ireland to the Rebels, or to ſome of the Malignants; as either to the Marqueſſe Hartford, or the Corniſh Malignants.</p>
            <p>The next day, which was Friday the eleventh of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, it was a mighty Fogge at ſea, ſo that we could not ſee a furlong before us: and on a ſudden came tiding downe the channell three ſhips of good burden; and ere they eſpied us or we them, they were upon us within halfe Musket ſhot: wherefore we ſhot off a warning-piece for them to come in, but our Colours being not diſcernable by reaſon of the Miſt, they refuſed to ſtrike their tops, but let flye a broad ſide at us, and we againe at them: but they finding the ſervice too hot, ran downe the channell as faſt as they could poſſible, ſtriving to quit us; wee thundring on them with our great Guns as faſt as we could poſſible. Now the wind beginning to blow, the Fogge cleared, and wee diſcerned them to be States Men of War our friends. So heaving ſome Cans of Wine one to another, we were very ſorry for the harme wee had done them, and departed.</p>
            <p>Theſe are all the paſſages of note that befell us here late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where thanks be to God we are in good health, reſolving to ſpend our blood in the ſervice of the Parliament.</p>
